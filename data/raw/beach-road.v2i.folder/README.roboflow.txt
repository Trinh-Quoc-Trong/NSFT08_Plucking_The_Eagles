The dataset includes 1242 images.
Beach-and-road are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 224x224 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
